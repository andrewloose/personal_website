            <p class="featured-intro">
                This is one of the most beautiful pieces of autobiographical writing I've ever encountered. Nabokov's "The Perfect Past" demonstrates his mastery of memory as both subject and artistic medium. Originally published in The New Yorker in 1950, this essay would later become the opening chapter of his memoir "Speak, Memory." I find his exploration of consciousness, time, and the crystalline precision of childhood recollection absolutely mesmerizing.

            <div class="essay-body">
                <p>The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness. Although the two are identical twins, man, as a rule, views the prenatal abyss with more calm than the one he is heading for (at some forty-five hundred heartbeats an hour). I know, however, of a sensitive youth who experienced something like panic when looking for the first time at some old homemade movies that had been taken a few weeks before his birth. He saw a world that was practically unchanged—the same house, the same people—and then realized that he did not exist there at all and that nobody mourned his absence. What particularly frightened him was the sight of a brand-new baby carriage standing there on the porch, with the smug, encroaching air of a coffin; even that was empty, as if, in the reverse course of events, his very bones had disintegrated.</p>

                <p>Such fancies are not foreign to young lives. Or, to put it otherwise, first and last things often tend to have an adolescent note—unless, possibly, they are directed by some venerable and rigid religion. Nature expects a full-grown man to accept the two black voids, fore and aft, as stolidly as he accepts the extraordinary visions in between. Imagination, the supreme delight of the immortal and the immature, should be limited. In order to enjoy life, we should not enjoy it too much.</p>

                <p>I rebel against this state of affairs. I feel the urge to take my rebellion outdoors and picket nature. Over and over again, my mind has made colossal efforts to distinguish the faintest of personal glimmers in the impersonal darkness on both sides of my life. That this darkness is caused merely by the Walls of time separating me and my bruised fists from the free world of timelessness is a belief I gladly share with the most gaudily painted savage. I have journeyed back in thought—with thought hopelessly tapering off as I went—to remote regions where I groped for some secret outlet, only to discover that the prison of time is spherical and without exits. Short of suicide, I have tried everything. I have doffed my identity in order to pass for a conventional spook and steal into realms that existed before I was conceived. I have mentally endured the degrading company of Victorian lady novelists and retired colonels who remembered having, in former lives, been slave messengers on a Roman road or sages under the willows of Lhasa. I have ransacked my oldest dreams for keys and clues—and let me say at once that I reject completely the vulgar, shabby, fundamentally medieval world of Freud, with its crankish quest for sexual symbols (something like searching for Baconian acrostics in Shakespeare's works), and its bitter little embryos spying upon the love life of their parents.</p>

                <p>Initially, I was unaware that time, so boundless at first blush, was a prison. In probing my childhood—which is the next best to probing one's eternity—I see the awakening of consciousness as a series of spaced flashes, with the intervals between them gradually diminishing until bright blocks of perception are formed, affording memory a slippery hold. I had learned numbers and speech more or less simultaneously, and the revelation that I was I and that my parents were my parents was directly associated with my discovering their age in relation to mine. Judging by the strong sunlight that, when I think of this revelation, immediately invades my memory with lobed sun flecks through overlapping patterns of greenery, the occasion was my father's birthday, in midsummer, in the country, and I had asked questions and had assessed the answers I received. All this is as it should be according to the theory of recapitulation; the beginning of reflexive consciousness in the brain of our remotest ancestor must surely have coincided with the dawning of the sense of time.</p>

                <p>Thus, when the newly disclosed, fresh and green formula of my own age—three—was confronted with the parental formulas (thirty-three and twenty-seven) something happened to me. I was given a tremendously invigorating shock. As if subjected to a second baptism (on more divine lines than the Greek Orthodox ducking I had undergone only thirty-nine months before), I felt myself plunged all of a sudden into a radiant and mobile medium that was none other than the pure element of time. One shared it, just as excited bathers share shining sea water, with creatures that were not you but that were joined to you by time's common flow, an environment quite different from the spatial one, which not only man but apes and butterflies can perceive. At that instant, I became acutely aware that the twenty-seven-year-old being, in soft white and pink, holding my left hand, was my mother, and that the thirty-three-year-old being, in hard white and gold, holding my right hand, was my father. Between them, as they evenly progressed, I strutted, and trotted, and strutted again, along the middle of a sunny path, which I easily identify today with an alley of ornamental oak trees in the park of our country estate, in the Province of St. Petersburg. Indeed, I appear to my present self as jubilantly celebrating, on that twenty-first of July, 1902, the birth of sentient life. If my left-hand-holder and my right-hand-holder had both been present before in my vague infant world, they had been so under the mask of a tender incognito, but now my father's attire, the resplendent uniform of the Horse Guards, with that smooth golden swell of cuirass burning upon his chest and back, came out like the sun, and for several years afterward I remained keenly interested in the age of my parents and kept myself informed about it, like a nervous passenger asking the time in order to check a new watch.</p>

                <p>My father, let it be noted, had served his term of military training long before I was born, so I suppose he had that day put on the trappings of his former regiment as a festive joke. To a joke, then, I owe my first gleam of complete consciousness—which again has recapitulatory implications, since the first creatures on earth to become aware of time were also the first creatures to smile.</p>

                <p>It was the primordial cave (and not what Freudian mystics might suppose) that lay behind the games I played when I was three or four. A big cretonne-covered divan in one of the drawing rooms of our country home rises in my mind, like some massive product of a geological upheaval before the beginning of history. History begins (with the promise of fair Greece) not far from one end of this divan, where a large potted hydrangea shrub, with pale-blue blossoms and some greenish ones, half conceals, in a corner of the room, a marble bust of Diana. On the wall against which the divan stands, another phase of history is marked by a gray engraving in an ebony frame—one of those Napoleonic-battle pictures in which the episodic and the allegoric are the real adversaries and where you see, all grouped together on the same plane of vision, a wounded drummer, a dead horse, trophies, one soldier about to bayonet another, and the invulnerable Emperor posing with his generals amid the frozen fray.</p>

                <p>With the help of some grown-up person, who would use first both hands and then a powerful leg, the divan would be moved several inches away from the wall, so as to form a narrow passage, which I would be further helped to roof snugly with the divan's bolsters and close up at the ends with a couple of its cushions. I then had the fantastic pleasure of creeping through that pitch-dark tunnel, where I lingered a little to listen to the singing in my ears—that lonesome vibration so familiar to small boys in dusty hiding places—and then, in a burst of delicious panic, on rapidly thudding hands and knees I would reach the tunnel's far end, push its cushion away, and be welcomed by the sunshine on the polished floor and by a cloud of flowers. A dreamier and more delicate sensation was provided by another cave game, when upon awakening in the early morning I made a tent of my bedclothes and let my imagination play in a thousand dim ways with shadowy snowslides of linen and with the faint light that seemed to penetrate my penumbral covert from some immense distance, where I fancied that strange, pale animals roamed in a landscape of lakes. The recollection of my crib with its nets of fluffy cotton cords enclosing the sides, brings back, too, the pleasure of handling a certain beautiful, delightfully solid, garnet-dark crystal egg left over from some unremembered Easter; I used to chew a corner of the bedsheet until it was thoroughly soaked and then wrap the egg in it tightly, so as to watch the ruddy glitter of the snugly held object seep through, with a miraculous completeness of glow and color. And this is the closest I ever got to feeding upon beauty.</p>

                <p>I may be inordinately fond of my earliest impressions, but then I have reason to be grateful to them. They led the way into a veritable Eden of visual and tactile sensations. One night, during a trip abroad—in 1903, I think—I recall kneeling on my pillow under the window of a sleeping car (probably on the Mediterranean Train de Luxe—the one whose cars had the lower part of their bodies painted in umber and the upper panels in white) and seeing, with an inexplicable pang, a handful of distant lights that beckoned to me from the folds of a hill and then slipped into a pocket of black velvet. Nothing is sweeter or stranger than to ponder those first thrills. They belong to the harmonious world of a perfect childhood and, as such, possess a naturally plastic form in one's memory, which can be set down with hardly any effort; it is only starting with the recollections of one's adolescence that Mnemosyne begins to get choosy and crabbed. I would, moreover, submit that, in regard to the power to hoard up impressions, Russian children of my generation passed through a period of genius, as if destiny were loyally trying what it could for them by giving them more than their share, in view of the cataclysm that was to remove completely the world they had known. Genius disappeared when everything had been stored, just as it does with those other, more specialized child prodigies—pretty, curly-headed youngsters waving batons or taming enormous pianos, who eventually turn into second-rate musicians with sad eyes and obscure ailments and something vaguely misshapen about their eunuchoid hindquarters. But even so, the individual mystery remains to tantalize the memoirist. Neither in environment nor in heredity can I find the exact instrument that fashioned me, the anonymous roller that pressed upon my life a certain intricate watermark with a unique design, which becomes visible when the lamp of art is made to shine through life's foolscap.</p>

                <p>To fix correctly, in terms of time, some of my childhood recollections, I have to go by comets and eclipses, as historians do when they tackle the fragments of a saga. But in other cases there is no dearth of data. I see myself, for instance, clambering over wet black rocks at the seaside while Miss Norcott, a languid and melancholy English governess, who thinks I am following her, strolls away along the curved beach with my brother. As I crawl over those rocks, I keep repeating, in a kind of zestful, copious, and deeply gratifying incantation, the English word "childhood," which sounds mysterious and new, and becomes stranger and stranger as it gets mixed up in my small, overstocked, hectic mind with Robin Hood and Little Red Riding Hood and the brown hoods of old hunchbacked fairies. There are dimples in the rocks, full of tepid sea water, and my magic muttering accompanies certain spells I am weaving over the tiny sapphire pools.</p>

                <p>The place is Abbazia, on the Adriatic. About the same time, at a café in nearby Fiume, my father happened to notice, just as we were being served, two Japanese officers at a table near us, and we immediately left—not without my hastily snatching a whole bombe of lemon sherbet, which I carried away secreted in my aching mouth. The year was 1904. I was five. Russia was fighting Japan. With hearty relish, the English illustrated weekly Miss Norcott subscribed to reproduced war pictures by Japanese artists that showed how the Russian locomotives—made singularly toylike by the Japanese pictorial style—would drown if our Army tried to lay rails across the treacherous ice of Lake Baikal.</p>

                <p>But let me see. I had an even earlier association with that war. One afternoon at the beginning of the same year, in our St. Petersburg house, I was led down from the nursery into my father's study to say how-do-you-do to a friend of the family, General Kuropatkin. To amuse me, the General spread out a handful of matches on the divan where he was sitting, placed ten of them end to end to make a horizontal line, and said, "This is the sea in calm weather." Then he tipped up each pair so as to turn the straight line into a zigzag—and that was "a stormy sea." He scrambled the matches and was about to do, I hoped, a better trick when we were interrupted. His aide-de-camp was shown in and said something to him. With a Russian flustered grunt, Kuropatkin immediately rose from his seat, the loose matches jumping up on the divan as his weight left it. That day, Kuropatkin had been ordered to assume supreme command of the Russian Army in the Far East.</p>

                <p>This incident had a special sequel fifteen years later, when at a certain point of my father's flight from Bolshevik-held St. Petersburg to southern Russia he was accosted, while crossing a bridge, by an old man who looked like a gray-bearded peasant in his sheepskin coat. He asked my father for a light. The next moment each recognized the other. Whether or not old Kuropatkin, in his rustic disguise, managed to evade Soviet imprisonment is immaterial. What pleases me is the evolution of the match theme: Those magic ones the General had shown me had been trifled with and mislaid, and his armies had also vanished, and everything had fallen through, like my toy trains that, in the winter of 1904-05, in Wiesbaden, I had tried to run over the frozen puddles in the grounds of the Hotel Oranien. The following of such thematic designs through one's life should be, I think, the true purpose of autobiography.</p>

                <p>The close of Russia's disastrous campaign in the Far East was accompanied by furious internal disorders. Undaunted by them, my mother, with her three children, returned to our country home after almost a year of foreign resorts. This was the summer of 1905. State matters required the presence of my father in the capital; the Constitutionalist Democratic Party, of which he was one of the founders, was to win a majority of seats in the first parliament the following year. During one of his short stays with us in the country, he ascertained, with patriotic dismay, that my brother and I could read and write English but not Russian. It was decided that the village schoolmaster should come every afternoon to give us lessons and take us for walks.</p>

                <p>With a strident and merry blast from the whistle that was part of my first sailor suit, my childhood calls me back into that distant past to have me shake hands again with my delightful teacher. He had a fuzzy brown beard and china-blue eyes. He sported a flowing black tie carelessly knotted in a bow-like arrangement. In addressing me, a small boy, he used the plural of the second person—not in the stiff way the servants did, and not as my mother would do in moments of intense tenderness, when my temperature had gone up or I had lost some little toy (as if the singular were too thin to bear the load of her love), but with the polite plainness of one man speaking to another whom he does not know well enough to use "thou" to. A fiery revolutionary (later, under Lenin's regime, to be executed with other non-Communist radicals of the Social-Revolutionary Party), he would gesture vehemently on our country rambles and speak of humanity and freedom and the badness of warfare and the sad—but interesting, I thought—necessity of blowing up tyrants, and then he would produce the then popular pacifist book "Doloy Oruzhie!," a translation of Bertha von Suttner's "Die Waffen Nieder!," and treat me, a child of six, to tedious quotations. I would try to refute them; at that tender and bellicose age, I spoke up for bloodshed and angry defense of my world of toy pistols and Arthurian knights.</p>

                <p>To him, in a way, I owe the ability to continue for another stretch along my private footpath, which runs parallel to the road of that troubled decade. When, in July, 1906, the Czar unconstitutionally dissolved the parliament, a number of its members, my father among them, held a rebellious session in Viborg and issued a manifesto. For this, a year and a half later, they were imprisoned. My father spent a restful, if somewhat lonesome, three months in solitary confinement, with his books, his collapsible bathtub, and his copy of J. P. Muller's manual of home gymnastics. To the end of her days, my mother preserved the letters he managed to smuggle through to her—cheerful epistles written in pencil on toilet paper. We were in the country when he regained his liberty, and it was the village schoolmaster who directed the festivities and arranged the bunting (some of it frankly red) to greet my father on his way home from the railway station. My mother and we children had gone down to the village, and it is when I recall that particular day that I see with the utmost clarity the sun-spangled river; the bridge, and the dazzling tin of a can left by a fisherman on its wooden railing; the linden-treed hill with its rosy-red church and marble mausoleum where my mother's dead reposed; the dusty road to the village; the strip of short, pastel-green grass, with bald patches of sandy soil, between the road and the lilac bushes behind which walleyed, mossy log cabins stood in a rickety row; the stone building of the new schoolhouse near the wooden old one; and, as we swiftly drove by, the little black dog with very white teeth that dashed out from among the cottages at a terrific pace but in absolute silence, saving his voice for the brief outburst he would enjoy when his muted spurt would at last bring him close to the speeding carriage.</p>

                <p>The old and the new, the liberal touch and the patriarchal one, fatal poverty and fatalistic wealth got fantastically interwoven in that strange first decade of our century. Several times during a summer it might happen that in the middle of luncheon, in the bright, many-windowed, walnut-panelled dining room on the first floor of our country home, Alexey, the butler, with an unhappy expression on his face, would bend over and inform my father in a low voice (especially low if we had company) that a group of villagers wanted to see the <em>barin</em> outside. Briskly, my father would remove his napkin from his lap and ask my mother to excuse him. One of the windows at the east end of the dining room gave upon a portion of the drive near the main entrance. From that direction the courteous buzz of a peasant welcome would reach us as the invisible group greeted my invisible father. The ensuing parley, conducted in ordinary tones, would not be heard, as the windows underneath which it took place were closed to keep out the heat. It presumably had to do with a plea for his mediation in some local feud, or with some special subsidy, or with the permission to harvest some bit of our land or cut down a coveted clump of our trees. If, as usually happened, the request was at once granted, there would be again that buzz, and then, in token of gratitude, the good <em>barin</em> would be put through the national ordeal of being rocked and tossed up and securely caught by a score or so of strong arms.</p>

                <p>In the dining room, my brother and I would be told to go on with our food. My mother, a tidbit between finger and thumb, would glance under the table to see if her nervous and gruff dachshund was there. "Un jour ils vont le laisser tomber" would come from Mlle. Golay, a primly pessimistic old lady who had been my mother's governess and still dwelt with us—on awful terms with our own governesses. From my place at table I would suddenly see through one of the east windows a marvellous case of levitation. There, for an instant, the figure of my father in his wind-rippled white summer suit would be displayed, gloriously sprawling in midair, his limbs in a curiously casual attitude, his handsome, imperturbable features turned to the sky. Thrice, to the mighty heave-ho of his invisible tossers, he would fly up in this fashion, and the second time he would go higher than the first, and then there he would be, on his last and loftiest flight, reclining, as if for good, against the cobalt blue of the summer noon, like one of those paradisiac personages who comfortably soar, with such a wealth of folds in their garments, on the vaulted ceiling of a church while below, one by one, the wax tapers in mortal hands light up to make a swarm of minute flames in the mist of incense, and the priest chants of eternal repose, and funeral lilies conceal the face of whoever lies there, among the swimming lights, in the open coffin.</p>
